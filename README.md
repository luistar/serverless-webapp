# serverless-webapp

A very simple serverless web app built as part of my talk on AWS for the Advanced Techniques for Software Engineering class (CompSci major @ Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli "Federico II"). 
This app is the serverless version of [serverful-webapp](https://github.com/luistar/serverful-webapp).

## Main features
This app features:
* User sign up and authentication with AWS Cognito and AWS Amplify;
* Language detection and sentiment analysis on user comments using AWS Comprehend;
